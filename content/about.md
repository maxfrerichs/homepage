## tl;dr
I'm a 24-year old guy that dropped out from school sometime in 2017, applied for an internship at the local IT company, web development and finally graduated from the apprenticeship as a IT specialist in software development last year.
Since them, I'm working as a full-stack web developer at LfdA - Labor f√ºr digitale Angelegenheiten GmbH, a small IT company based in Hamburg (Germany), specialized in developing customized web-based solutions for any kind of problem.

## About my work
In my job as a full-stack web developer I'm developing and maintaining complex websites based on TYPO3, an open-source enterprise-class CMS. I'm experienced in working with TYPO3 in many aspects - from integrating templates with Fluid and TypoScript and extension development to performing LTS upgrades for older TYPO3 installations. I'm also developing andf maintaining some design systems based on Pangolin.js with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
