As you may already know, I'm working mostly with Content Management Systems at my job, so why I'm using a static site generator I've never worked before with? The answer is pretty simple: Because I don't need most of the funcionality a full-featured CMS has to offer. Thinking about TYPO3, this CMS has not only it's own configuration meta-language called TypoScript, it also features it's own templating engine, it's own APIs and even a complete Domain-driven design MVC framework named Extbase including everything needed for developing large web apps. While being very useful for large customer projects, it's just not the choice for a small website like this.

The answer is: I don't like WordPress at all. While being useful for people with low to no knowlegde in web development that just want to have a small site for their local business or blog, WordPress is absolutely terrible from a technical perspective. The source code is imho a complete mess and the whole thing is full of holes like swiss cheese, speaking about security vulnerabilities.

tl;dr: Not every tool you like working with is a good choice for developing a solution for a specific problem

Have a great day!
