      <description>As you may already know, I&amp;rsquo;m working mostly with Content Management Systems at my job, so why I&amp;rsquo;m using a static site generator I&amp;rsquo;ve never worked before with? The answer is pretty simple: Because I don&amp;rsquo;t need most of the funcionality a full-featured CMS has to offer. Thinking about TYPO3, this CMS has not only it&amp;rsquo;s own configuration meta-language called TypoScript, it also features it&amp;rsquo;s own templating engine, it&amp;rsquo;s own APIs and even a complete Domain-driven design MVC framework named Extbase including everything needed for developing large web apps.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;As you may already know, I&amp;rsquo;m working mostly with Content Management Systems at my job, so why I&amp;rsquo;m using a static site generator I&amp;rsquo;ve never worked before with? The answer is pretty simple: Because I don&amp;rsquo;t need most of the funcionality a full-featured CMS has to offer. Thinking about TYPO3, this CMS has not only it&amp;rsquo;s own configuration meta-language called TypoScript, it also features it&amp;rsquo;s own templating engine, it&amp;rsquo;s own APIs and even a complete Domain-driven design MVC framework named Extbase including everything needed for developing large web apps. While being very useful for large customer projects, it&amp;rsquo;s just not the choice for a small website like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But why you don&amp;rsquo;t use WordPress? It&amp;rsquo;s a simple blogging software perfectly suited for a site like this&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is: I don&amp;rsquo;t like WordPress at all. While being useful for people with low to no knowlegde in web development that just want to have a small site for their local business or blog, WordPress is absolutely terrible from a technical perspective. The source code is imho a complete mess and the whole thing is full of holes like swiss cheese, speaking about security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: Not every tool you like working with is a good choice for developing a solution for a specific problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a great day!
Max&lt;/p&gt;
